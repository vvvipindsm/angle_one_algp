    "#### Buying a Car is the dream of many. However, every individual decides on a fixed budget before taking any final decision on buying a car. There are several car manufacturers in the market which create various models. A lot of pre- launch research is required before introducing any new model in the market as launching a new car involves a lot of cost and investment in the form of R&D,  marketing, manufacturing and logistics. A wrong market study can lead to huge debt on company’s balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An automobile company is planning to expand and introduce new models in US market. But before doing that market research is required on what type of cars US citizens prefer, who is more likely to buy cars, what is the income of folks who buys car etc. As a Data Scientist, you have been provided with Car Owners data from US cities. Applying numerical and visual summarization of data, come up with meaningful and beneficial insights."
