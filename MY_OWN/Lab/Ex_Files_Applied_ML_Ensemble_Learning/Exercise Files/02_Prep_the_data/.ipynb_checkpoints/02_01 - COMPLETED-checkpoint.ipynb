As noted in the description on Kaggle's website, some people aboard the ship were more likely to survive the wreck than others. There were not enough lifeboats for everybody so women, children, and the upper-class were prioritized. Using the information about these 891 passengers, the challenge is to build a model to predict which people would survive based on the following fields:\n",

    "_You'll see each of the features that we discussed above. The survived column is the one that we'll be trying to predict (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived) and all of the other columns are to be considered as potential features for the model. As I mentioned before, in this section we will be cleaning the data and then writing out our training, validation, and test sets. The main idea behind cleaning the data is it allows us to format or structure the data as well as possible to potentially predict whether a person survived or not. If you are interested in digging more into this topic, feel free to take a look at my Feature Engineering course that is part of this Applied Machine Learning course._\n",
