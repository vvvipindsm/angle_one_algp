    "_Lets start by importing our packages - so we have the same `joblib`, `pandas` to read in our data, and `GridSearchCV` from `sklearn` that we have used in prior chapters. Now we are also going to import our StackingClassifier from `sklearn` and we also have to import the objects we will use to fit our base models - so we are going to import gradient boosting and random forest. Again, those will represent our base models and we will stick with those since we are pretty familiar with them from earlier in the course. Then we are also going to import LogisticRegression from sklearn, we will use that logistic regression for our meta model. If you want to learn more about Logistic Regression and the key hyperparameters, take a look at my algorithms course in this Applied ML series._\n",

Lets start by creating our StackingClassifier in the same way we did in the last video. So we will define our estimators - we will have one RandomForest model and one Gradient Boosting model and leave the parentheses empty because we will define those parameters in our parameters dictionary. So this is a very, very simple stacking model with only two base models. Now lets create our StackingClassifier and remember it requires us to pass in the list of estimators and assign it to the estimators hyperparameter._\n",

    "_Then lets call the `get params` method to refresh our memory on the name of the parameters we want to tweak. In the interest of time, we are going to keep it quite simple. So we know there are a number of parameters we can tweak for gradient boosting and random forest but we are going to focus only on n estimators - so we will only tweak the number of trees each use.

    "_So first of all - we see this warning pertaining to the Logistic Regression meta model not converging in the given number of iterations and it suggests scaling our data. So this only pertains to the cases where we are including the original training data, Logistic Regression does not necessarily require your data to be properly scaled but it does perform a bit better when you do that. So feel free to play around with scaling the data and exploring if that improves your performance at all. In the interest of time, we will move forward with the unscaled data. If you want a refresher on how to scale your training data, check out my Foundations course for the Applied ML series._\n",
